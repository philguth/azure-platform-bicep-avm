Read and follow the [shared speckit-converge instructions](../../../.github/skills/speckit-converge/SKILL.md).
Resolve relative links in that document from its own directory.
Use the user's request as the value of `$ARGUMENTS`.
When those instructions name a Copilot `/speckit-<command>` invocation,
use the corresponding Codex `$speckit-<command>` skill instead.
Keep workflow rules in the shared file; this file is only a Codex entry point.
